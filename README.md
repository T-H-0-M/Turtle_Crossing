# Turtle_Crossing

This program is a simple game where the player controls a turtle character to avoid cars and reach the finish line. It uses the Turtle module for graphics and includes multiple classes for managing different aspects of the game.

## Features

- The player can move their character up the screen by pressing the Up arrow key.
- Cars are generated and move across the screen from right to left.
- The player must avoid colliding with the cars. If a collision occurs, the game ends.
- The player can reach the finish line by reaching the top of the screen, and the level increases.
- The game displays the current level and a "GAME OVER" message when the game ends.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install Python if it is not already installed on your system.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` file to start the game. The game window will open, and the player can control the turtle character using the Up arrow key. Avoid the cars and try to reach the finish line to increase your level. If you collide with a car, the game will end, and a "GAME OVER" message will be displayed.
